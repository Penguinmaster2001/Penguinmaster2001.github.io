                <p>
                    Hello! I'm a Computer Science and Mathematics student at the University of Victoria (UVic), and a Co-Lead of the Software Team at UVicâ€™s Environmental Engineering Club (UVEEC). I'm extremely passionate about programming and math, in particular, exploring and implementing mathematical concepts through programming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At UVEEC, I'm tasked with designing a control system for an underwater glider. We heavily focus on planning, and documentation to ensure the club's mission will be continued even after I graduate. I also organize skill development sessions for tools widely used in industry such as Git, Linux, ROS 2, and many more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also regularly work on personal projects to explore my interests outside of school and the club, like shader programming, game development, and simulations.
                </p>
